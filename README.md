# Mutual Fund Category & Performance Visualization  
**Interactive Web-Based Financial Dashboard | D3.js v7 | Kent State University Team Project**

## Overview
This project presents an interactive financial dashboard that enables users to explore performance metrics, expense ratios, and category-wise asset distribution across U.S. mutual funds. Built using D3.js v7 and deployed via GitHub Pages, the system supports real-time data visualization with high interactivityâ€”ideal for financial analysts, investors, and educators.

Developed as part of the *Information Visualization* course at Kent State University, the project emphasizes accessibility, usability, and decision-support for non-technical users engaging with complex mutual fund data.

## Visualization Tasks

### Task 1: Compare Fund Performance Over Time  
**Grouped Bar Chart** for 3MO, YTD, 1YR, 3YR, 5YR, 10YR returns

- Dropdown: Sort by selected return period
- Brushing: View Top 10, Top 20, or Top 50 funds
- Tooltip: View exact return values on hover
- Scroll: Navigate horizontal overflow

---

### Task 2: Analyze Expense Ratio vs Performance  
**Scatter Plot** comparing return % vs. fund expense ratio

- Dropdown: Switch between different return periods
- Tooltip: Display fund name, return, and fee
- Color scale: Encodes return strength visually
- Axes adjust automatically to data range

> File: `task2_scatter_plot/task2_index.html`

### Task 3: Explore Fund Categories by Assets  
**Treemap** for visualizing asset concentration by fund category

- Zoom interaction: Click to enlarge a category
- Reset button: Return to full view
- Tooltip: Category name, total assets, fund count, asset share %
- Color scale: Relative total assets

- Derived from anonymized mutual fund performance records
- Cleaned with custom scripts to standardize formats
- Includes returns (3MO to 10YR), net assets, expense ratios, and categories
- Aggregated per category for treemap view
